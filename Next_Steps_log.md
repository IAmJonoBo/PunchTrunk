# Next Steps Log

- 2025-10-30: Created baseline tracking with tasks for offline bundle auto-download work, recorded initial QA results (Go tests failing; lint/security pending).
- 2025-10-30: Added automated download tests for Linux/macOS flows, implemented trunk auto-download fallback, noted missing dependencies (BATS, Trunk CLI, Semgrep) blocking full QA.
- 2025-10-30: Normalized offline bundle target naming, expanded shell coverage for default naming, and documented QA gaps (Go tests still failing on SARIF redirect expectations; lint/security blocked by missing tools).
