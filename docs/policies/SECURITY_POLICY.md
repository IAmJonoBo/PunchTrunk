# Security Policy

- Threat model maintained in `/docs/policies/THREAT_MODEL.md`.
- OWASP ASVS + Top 10 as baseline controls.
- Least privilege everywhere; rotate keys; encrypt in transit/at rest.
- Report issues: security@n00tropic.example (responsible disclosure).

Hard rules: never commit secrets; never exfiltrate user data.
