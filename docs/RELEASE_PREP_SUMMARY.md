#### Installation Methods ✅
1. **Quick Install Script**:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IAmJonoBo/PunchTrunk/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
   ```
   - Detects platform automatically
   - Downloads appropriate binary
   - Verifies checksums
   - Installs to `/usr/local/bin`

2. **Manual Download**:
   - Direct download from GitHub Releases
   - Platform-specific binaries
   - Includes checksums

3. **Container Image**:
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/iamjonobo/punchtrunk:latest
   ```

4. **From Source**:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

#### Version Support ✅
- Added `--version` flag to CLI
- Version embedded at build time
- Makefile supports `VERSION` environment variable
- Default version: "dev"

### 3. Documentation

  - Jenkins (declarative pipeline)
- Ephemeral runner optimization strategies
- Container-based workflows
- Kubernetes pod examples
- Best practices for caching, timeouts, error handling
- Troubleshooting section

#### Updated README ✅
- Added comprehensive Installation section
- Multiple installation methods documented
- Quick start guide simplified
- Links to integration guide

## Release Readiness

### Pre-Release Checklist
- [x] All roadmap items implemented
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Release workflow tested (dry-run via workflow file validation)
- [x] Installation script created and tested
- [x] Version support implemented
- [x] Security scanning passed
- [x] Code review passed

### How to Release

1. **Create and push a tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "PunchTrunk v1.0.0 - Initial release"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Workflow automatically**:
   - Builds binaries for all platforms
   - Generates checksums
   - Builds and signs container images
   - Creates GitHub Release
   - Uploads all artifacts
   - Generates release notes
   - Validates deployment

3. **Post-release**:
   - Monitor GitHub Code Scanning uploads
   - Announce release
   - Update roadmap if needed

### Manual Release (if needed)

Use workflow dispatch:
```bash
# Via GitHub UI: Actions → Release → Run workflow
# Enter tag: v1.0.0
```

## Architecture Compliance
