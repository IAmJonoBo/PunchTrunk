# Coding Standards

`../CONVENTIONS.md` is the canonical reference for repository-wide expectations. Use this page as a quick set of principles and pointers to deeper material.

- **Clarity beats cleverness.** Name things like you mean it.
- **DRY:** one source of truth; refactor duplication on sight.
- **YAGNI:** implement todayâ€™s needs; design for tomorrow.
- Language-specific style guides: document per language in subfolders or link from `../CONVENTIONS.md`.
- Error handling, logging, and input validation are part of the design.
- Public APIs are documented and versioned (SemVer).

## Commit & PR Discipline

- Conventional Commits; small PRs; checklist completed.
- For AI-assisted changes note material assistance in the PR (see `../ai/COPILOT_USAGE.md`).
