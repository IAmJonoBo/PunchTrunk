# Toolchain Setup

`../workflows/local-dev.md` already walks through the full bootstrap process (Go toolchain, Trunk CLI, common commands). Treat this page as a short index into the canonical guide:

- Local prerequisites and bootstrap: `../workflows/local-dev.md`
- Trunk and formatter configuration: `../trunk-config.md`
- Security posture during setup: `../security-supply-chain.md`
- IDE tips and AI guardrails: `../ai/COPILOT_USAGE.md`
- Docker build + runtime details: `../releasing.md` (packaging steps) and `Dockerfile` walkthrough.
- Troubleshooting caches and tool versions: `../operations/ci.md` (Cache section) and `Makefile` targets `build`, `run`, `hotspots`.
