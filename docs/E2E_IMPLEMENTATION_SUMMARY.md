### 2. Test Implementation

#### E2E Test Suite (`cmd/punchtrunk/e2e_test.go`)
Comprehensive test coverage with **6 test scenarios**:

1. **TestE2EHappyPath** - Complete workflow validation
   - Tests: fmt → lint → hotspots → SARIF generation
   - Multi-file Go project with README
   - Validates all modes work together

2. **TestE2EChangedFiles** - Change prioritization
   - Multiple commits creating churn
   - Validates changed files rank higher in hotspots
   - Tests git history integration

3. **TestE2EAutofixModes** - Autofix mode validation
   - Tests all modes: none, fmt, lint, all
   - Validates flag handling
   - Ensures proper mode selection

4. **TestE2EErrorHandling** - Graceful degradation
   - Invalid base branch handling
   - Binary file handling
   - Validates error resilience

5. **TestE2EMultiLanguage** - Language support
   - Tests Go, Python, JavaScript, Markdown
   - Validates all files processed correctly
   - Ensures hotspot computation works across languages

6. **TestE2EKitchenSink** - **COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION** ⭐
   - **10-phase validation process**
   - Multi-language repository with realistic history
   - All PunchTrunk modes (fmt, lint, hotspots)
   - Churn detection and complexity scoring
   - SARIF 2.1.0 schema validation
   - File coverage validation
   - Error resilience testing
   - **Final quality gate before release**

#### Kitchen Sink Test Details

The Kitchen Sink test is the most comprehensive validation:

**Phase 1**: Create multi-language repository (Go, Python, JavaScript, Markdown)  
**Phase 2**: Generate realistic git churn (multiple commits, varying changes)  
**Phase 3**: Run PunchTrunk with all modes  
**Phase 4**: Compute hotspots with full context  
**Phase 5**: Validate hotspot results (ranking, scoring)  
**Phase 6**: Write and validate SARIF output  
**Phase 7**: Verify multi-language file coverage  
**Phase 8**: Validate complexity calculations  
**Phase 9**: Test error resilience (missing files)  
**Phase 10**: Final validation and reporting  

**Test Output**:
```
✓ Kitchen Sink test passed: all features validated
  - Multi-language support: Go, Python, JavaScript, Markdown
  - Hotspot computation: 6 files analyzed
  - SARIF generation: valid 2.1.0 format
  - Churn detection: correctly ranked high-churn files
  - Complexity scoring: all calculations valid
  - Error handling: gracefully handled edge cases
```

### 3. CI/CD Integration

#### E2E Workflow (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`)
Separate E2E workflow with **4 jobs**:

1. **e2e-tests** - Core E2E test execution
   - Runs all E2E scenarios
   - Includes Kitchen Sink test
   - Uploads test results as artifacts

2. **integration-with-trunk** - Real Trunk CLI integration
   - Installs actual Trunk CLI
   - Runs PunchTrunk with all modes
   - Validates SARIF output and schema
   - Uploads SARIF to Code Scanning

3. **performance-check** - Performance validation
   - Measures hotspot computation time
   - Validates < 2 minute completion
   - Monitors memory usage (< 500MB target)

4. **quality-gate** - Gate enforcement
   - Validates all jobs passed
   - Provides summary of gate status
   - Fails if any gate fails

#### Main CI Updates (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Added test execution step: `go test -v -timeout=5m ./...`
- Maintains existing lint and hotspot functionality
- Tests run before hotspot generation

### 4. Test Results

All tests passing:
```

### Architecture Principles
- Single binary design (no subpackages)
- Deterministic outputs (SARIF, logs)
- Graceful degradation (handles errors)
- Tool orchestration (Trunk for linting)
- Git integration (churn analysis)

## Usage

### Run Tests Locally
```bash
# All tests
go test -v ./...

# E2E tests only
go test -v ./cmd/punchtrunk -run "TestE2E"

# Kitchen sink test
go test -v ./cmd/punchtrunk -run "TestE2EKitchenSink"
```

### CI Execution
