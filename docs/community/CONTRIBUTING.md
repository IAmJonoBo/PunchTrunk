# Contributing (Project-Wide)

Use the repository root guide `../../CONTRIBUTING.md` as the canonical workflow. This stub keeps a quick reminder of where to look:

- Working agreements and review flow: `../../CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Coding and doc standards: `../CONVENTIONS.md`
- AI-specific guardrails: `../ai/COPILOT_USAGE.md`
- Release expectations: `../delivery/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`

When the canonical docs change, update the links here rather than duplicating the content.
