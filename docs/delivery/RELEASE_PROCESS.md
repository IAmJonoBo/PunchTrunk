# Release Process

`../releasing.md` remains the canonical step-by-step for PunchTrunk releases. Keep the detailed instructions there and use this page as a quick reminder of the supporting artefacts.

- SemVer: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
- Conventional Commits drive CHANGELOG.
- Canary/blue-green for risky deploys.
- Feature flags decouple deploy from release.
- Rollback is a **first-class** path.

Release notes checklist: `../templates/ReleaseNotes.md`.
